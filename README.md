# 🎓 GRE Admission Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting admission chances into graduate programs using applicant features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, academic ratings, and research experience.

## 📌 Overview

This notebook applies various regression techniques to forecast a student's likelihood of graduate program admission. With an intuitive data science workflow and a clean dataset, this project targets:

- Prospective students  
- ML beginners  
- Competitive data science training  

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Graduate Admissions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)  
- **Fields**:
  - GRE Score  
  - TOEFL Score  
  - University Rating  
  - SOP (Statement of Purpose Strength)  
  - LOR (Letter of Recommendation Strength)  
  - CGPA (Undergraduate GPA)  
  - Research (Research Experience)  
  - **Target Variable**: Chance of Admit (probability value between 0 and 1)

## 🔁 Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Accesses CSV file using `pandas`.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Handles missing values  
- Performs feature normalization  
- Optional: Feature engineering

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzes data distributions  
- Calculates feature correlations  
- Visualizes key insights

### 4. Modeling
- Builds regression models such as:
  - Linear Regression  
  - (Extendable to Ridge, Lasso, SVR, etc.)

### 5. Evaluation
- Performance metrics:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
  - R² Score  
- Visualization of predicted vs actual results

## 🛠 Usage

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gre-admission-prediction.git
cd gre-admission-prediction
